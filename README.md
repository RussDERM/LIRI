LIRI is a interactive node application that takes simple commands and performs functions with them.

She accepts commands through terminal input, and can return specific data related to your query.
To run her in node, input 'node liri' followed by your command, and then your query.

She can accept three different commands:
* 'concert-this' - shows concert data related to an artist name query
* 'movie-this' - shows movie data related to a movie title query
* 'spotify-this-song' - shows song data, related to a song title query

Enjoy!
